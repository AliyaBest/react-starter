## General info
Use this Simple React App starter as a starting point for small projects. It includes Webpack and Babel. I've found that using create-react-app to start my small projects often includes many items I don't need. And I wanted to save time on setting up my React app with all the dependencies and files. So, I created this starter.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* React: 16.13.1

## Dependencies
* @babel/core: 7.11.4
* @babel/preset-env: 7.11.0
* @babel/preset-react: 7.10.4
* babel-loader: 8.1.0
* webpack: 4.44.1
* webpack-cli: 3.3.12
* webpack-dev-server: 3.11.0
* react-dom: 16.13.1

## Setup
Fork and clone this repository to your computer. To run this project,



```
$ cd ../lorem
```
Add a .babelrc file and add the following:

```
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```
Install it locally using npm:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
